            <h2>About the book</h2>
            <p>
                This book is a childrens book that was written by Dr. Suess 
                and published in 1969 by Random House. This book is all 
                about feet. (not in a weird way) The book only has 132 words 
                in it and 47 of those words are some form of the word 'foot.'
